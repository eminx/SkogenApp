        <h1>Skogen user agreement</h1>
        <p>
          With an account, you are a member and can join any one or all of our
          study group’s online forums free of charge. If you join a study group,
          you will receive running updates about meetings for that group and can
          communicate with other participants via a discussion available at all
          times. Your username will be visible to other members on each group
          page you are a member of, both in the list of a group’s members and in
          a group’s discussion window.
        </p>
        <p>
          As a member you will also receive running notifications about things
          happening at Skogen, and can sign yourself up (RSVP) for events with a
          simple click. Your username will be visible for staff members in the
          list of attendees.
        </p>
        <p>
          The discussions for each study group are visible to all members of
          Skogen. These discussions are kept for the duration of the group and
          will be archived, but can be erased if the group wishes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Skogen expects all members to keep respectful and supportive language
          when communicating. We want to ensure a friendly and welcoming
          environment, while encouraging critical thinking and constructive
          dialogue. Members who go against these simple rules run the risk of
          having their membership removed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your personal information will never be shared with any external
          party. You can easily delete your membership anytime you want.
        </p>
        <p>
          For more information about how your personal information is handled,
          see our GDPR policy.

        <h3>Skogen's data policy, GDPR</h3>
        <p>
          GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) is an EU law that regulates
          how you as a user own your personal information and how you have the
          right to see it and know how it is used. Parties that collect, use,
          and store your private information do so only on loan, and must
          promise you that they will protect it against intrusion and store it
          safely according to the law. You must have knowledge of, and be able
          to agree or decline, as well as terminate, any usage and storage of
          your personal information.
        </p>
        <h4>What data we collect, how we store it, and why</h4>
        <p>
          Skogen collects only two pieces of information: a username and an
          e-mail address. Your e-mail address is considered personal
          information. The name you choose does not have to be your legal name,
          so if you choose to use your legal name you do so at your own
          discretion. This name will be displayed on the website only to other
          members: in the member list of groups you have joined; when sending
          discussion messages; and in the RSVP list when attending events (this
          latter visible only to staff).
        </p>
        <p>
          We use your e-mail address to send you notifications. Skogen collects
          this information when you sign up for an account, as well as when you
          change your account information. To login you will be asked to provide
          a password for your account. It is your responsibility to ensure this
          password is stored securely and is sufficiently robust.
        </p>
        <Divider />
        <h3>Data storage</h3>
        <p>
          Skogen uses cookies in your web browser for the sole purpose of
          storing your password. Your password is encrypted in our database, so
          there is no way we can access or read it. Your connection to Skogen is
          also encrypted using SSL (HTTPS).
        </p>
        <p>
          The list of e-mail addresses is secure and can be accessed only by the
          systems administrator and the website administrator.
        </p>
        <p>
          Discussion entries in groups associated with your username are stored
          for the duration of the group and are archived if the group ends and
          agrees to save its material. They are deleted only if the group
          requests it. Note that specifically deleting only the discussion
          entries associated with your own account is difficult and we may not
          be able to provide that service on request.
        </p>
        <Divider />

        <h3>Data sharing</h3>
        <p>
          We will never share or leave any of your personal information with any
          third party. We do not use any form of tracking, either on our own
          servers or via third parties.
        </p>
        <Divider />

        <h3>Access outside the EU/EES</h3>
        <p>
          The GDPR does not apply to countries outside the EU or EES. Your data
          accessible to third parties when accessed on a device outside the EU
          is not under the GDPR’s jurisdiction.
        </p>
        <Divider />

        <h3>Requesting information about your personal information</h3>
        <p>
          You can contact Skogen via e-mail to request anything about your
          personal information—what we store, how it is used, and if you want to
          change or remove it.
        </p>
        <Divider />

        <h3>Account deletion</h3>
        <p>
          You can delete your account at any time, which will delete all
          personal information associated with it. This can be accomplished by
          the “delete account” button on your user page, or by e-mailing us.
        </p>
        <Divider />

        <h3>How long is information stored?</h3>
        <p>
          Your personal information will be stored as long as you have an active
          account. We will regularly remove long inactive accounts.
